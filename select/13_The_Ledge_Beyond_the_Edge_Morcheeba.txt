Now flush it in
The grand canyons
Black falcons fly
I clash with titans in the sky
I blast the blizzard
Straight fire heal disease
I fought on Mars
Shot stars
Crush my enemies
Hark the herald
Black angel she sing
Glory be
To the new born king
I grew with Zeus
Rolled horses with wings
Colossal thought
From birth colossal things
Yeah???
Black angel survive
Come on
Come, come on
