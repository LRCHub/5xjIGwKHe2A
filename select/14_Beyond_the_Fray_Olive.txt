Take someone you know
They have climbed the highest tree
You think the fight was won
Take a look around

A smile should now appear
Beaming brightly ear to ear
Consolidate your stride
On solid ground

But what you see is all for show
There is no meaner man to know
You can run back to what you had
You're all alone

I'll mark the day
When we can meet beyond the fray
Don't lose the will to see your home
You find the way so we can meet beyond the fray
I'll fight to see that you get home

Consider this small clue
Look beyond your point of view
Make a space for honesty hide

Much of what you do
Smacks of one whose friends are few
Do the decent thing and jump the ride

But what you see is all for show
There is no meaner man to know
You can't run back to what you had
You're all alone

I'll mark the day
When we can meet beyond the fray
Don't lose the will to see your home
You find the way so we can meet beyond the fray
I'll fight to see that you get home

But what you see is all for show
There is no meaner man to know
You can't run back to what you had
You're all alone

I'll mark the day
When we can meet beyond the fray
Don't lose the will to see your home
You find the way so we can meet beyond the fray
I'll fight to see that you get home

I'll mark the day
When we can meet beyond the fray
Don't lose the will to see your home
You find the way so we can meet beyond the fray
I'll fight to see that you get home
